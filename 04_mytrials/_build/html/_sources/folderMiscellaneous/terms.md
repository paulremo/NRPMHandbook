:class: note
The purpose of the “terms specific for the present handbook” clause is to define terms specific to the [handbook].

```{admonition} **Requirements**
:class: seealso, dropdown
REQ_SP_01
: The following logic for deciding whether a term needs defining shall apply:

If Yes, no further action is needed. If no, go to 3.

3. The term is defined in ECSS-S-ST-00-01 “ECSS Glossary” and the definition is suitable (Y/N)
If Yes, do not generate new entry in 3.2, instead list term in 3.1. If No, go to 4.

4. The term is already defined elsewhere in ECSS and the definition is suitable (Y/N)
If Yes, list term in 3.1 and prepare a proposition for the raise of a CR to move the definition to ECSS-S-ST-00-01” ECSS Glossary for the case the handbook becomes an ECSS handbook eventually. If No, go to 5.

5. The term is already defined in an SDO document and the definition is sufficient (Y/N)

REQ_SP_02
: In creating a term, the following shall apply; 
1. Terms is to be in the singular form and

REQ_SP_03
: In creating a definition, the following shall apply: 
1. A definition provides the meaning of a term; Note: the objective is to provide the meaning of the term and not to detail a specification or explanation, and 
2. A definition is a partial single sentence; Note: the sentence starts in the lower case and is not punctuated at the end of the sentence, and 
3. A definition is worded so it can be directly substituted into the text instead of the term; Note: a definition that fails this criteria may be a convention that is entered in clause 3.4 and not clause 3.2. And 
4. The definition cannot contain formal verbs “shall”, “should”, “may” and “need not” as defined in 3.4.2, and 
5. A definition of a term does not repeat the term, nor any word used in the term, and 
6. If 5. Cannot be met, all or part of a term may be used in the definition where the term is a category (e.g. “Class 1 change” is a category of “change” with a unique definition in ECSS).

1. Definitions being listed in alphabetical order, and

## Convention and Nomenclature

````{admonition} **Requirements for Convention and Nomenclature**
:class: note
The purpose of the “convention” clause is to explain the specific conventions used in the standard, if any.

A convention provides a “rule-set”, generally in the form of a formulae, typology and logic, that establishes the relationship between at term and desired outcome or process. Examples would be:

* Graph indicating the relationship of terms expressed on the axes
* Equation or formulae expressing the terms and their relationship
* Choice of units for the significant terms or associated

This clause also includes the mandatory aspect of “nomenclature” where the meaning of the formal words that are used in ECSS to differentiate between informative and normative provisions.

: A convention shall state the formal relationship between entities (e.g. an expression of an equation).

REQ_CO_04
: A convention shall not comply with 3.2 REQ_SP_03. Note: a convention differs from a definition, as a convention is to be understood as means to express how something shall be derived whilst a definition is a statement of the exact meaning of a term.

: A convention shall provide a reference or source, from which this rule-set is adopted in other than ECSS.

REQ_CO_06
: Each convention shall be included in a separate sub-clause within clause 3.4.

REQ_CO_07
: The “conventions” clause shall not include requirements.
