    <td>Random failures are "one-off" events. They are modelled by a
    constant failure rate. In the frame of the Current document, a basic
    failure rate is attributed to a class of miscellaneous item, derived
    from IOR data and valid in a certain range of parameters. The model is
    only valid for the design lifetime. It can be used beyond the design
    lifetime in the case there is no wear.</td>

    event/situation with typical failure mechanisms in line with the item
    quality level, they are modelled as random failures.</p>
    <p>When it is no longer the case (obvious weakness in design, or actual
    design characteristics changed by manufacturing defect, premature
    wear-out before the end of the specified lifetime, weakness regarding
    the space environment) it is necessary to address and to model
    systematic failures. This is done based on statistics and not
    considering the human factor as an initial root cause.</p></td>

    modelling), only for miscellaneous items considered as lifetime-limited
    items. Safe life qualification is used to address wear-out failure based
    on probability distribution (parameters derived from the duration for
