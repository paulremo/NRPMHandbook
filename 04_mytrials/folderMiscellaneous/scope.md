# Scope

````{admonition} **Requirements for the scope**
:class: note
The purpose of the scope clause is to describe, in a few lines, the [handbook] as a whole in such a way that the reader can assess if the [handbook] is applicable or not to a particular case. The scope clause does not intend to recreate an expanded version of the TOC, chapter by chapter.

With this view, only a brief description of the subject of the [handbook] and statements of applicability are expected to appear in the scope clause. Statements of applicability state explicitly in which kind of projects or situations the standard is applicable (and for which is not applicable).

Any other descriptive material can be included in the introduction, e.g. history of the standard, rationale behind its preparation or relationships with other standards.

```{admonition} **Requirements**
:class: seealso, dropdown
REQ_SC_01
: The scope clause shall only describe: 
1. The subject of the [handbook] and aspects covered by it and 
2. The applicability of the [handbook].

REQ_SC_02
: The scope clause shall not contain requirements.

REQ_SC_03
: The scope clause shall have the layout of the “scope” of the example.
