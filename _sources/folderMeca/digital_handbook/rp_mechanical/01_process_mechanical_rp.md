# Process for mechanical reliability prediction

The approach for mechanical reliability prediction in space applications presented in this chapter is based on the following three steps, which are described in different Sections:

* Failure mechanism identification and focus ([Section 4.4](04_failure_identification_focus_mecha.md))
The goal of this step is to decide what needs to be modelled, allowing to focus the analysis on items and failure mechanisms with non-negligible probability of failure.
* Selection of suitable methods and models ([Section 4.5](05_method_selection_mechanical.md))
The method selection is centred around the dominating failure mechanisms identified in the first step with a focus on physics of failure methods for reliability prediction. A more general overview considering all potential methods and inputs is found in [Section 4.3](03_data_sources_methods_mechanical.md).
* Method implementation ([Sections 4.6](06_structural_method_input_mechanical.md) and [4.7](07_structural_models_equations_mechanical.md), [Section 4.8](08_examples_mechanical.md) for examples)
Methods and Models to derive reliability estimates for different failure mechanisms are discussed with a focus on Physics of Failure based methods. The implementation of other methods (e.g. statistical methods for a data-based approach) is discussed in [Section 4.3](03_data_sources_methods_mechanical.md).

Before addressing these three steps, the following information is provided:

* [Section 4.2](02_root_causes_coverage_mechanical.md) contains a discussion of the different failure root causes (as classified in Chapter 4 Part I) and their coverage during Mechanical reliability prediction.
* [Section 4.3](03_data_sources_methods_mechanical.md) contains a discussion of the different reliability prediction methods and inputs introduced in Chapter 6 (Part II).
