                    Safe life qualification alone is not sufficient as a justification to
                    discard the probability of premature mechanical wear-out failures before
                    the end of the nominal lifetime.</p>
                    <p>The consideration of additional failure mechanisms, which are assumed
                    to be effectively handled during nominal lifetime, may be required in
                    case of lifetime extensions (using the same methods, but with an
                    extended modelling scope).</p></td>

                    should be considered as stress contributors in the modelling of random
                    and wear-out failures, see Table 10-2 in Section 10.2.3 for the most
                    relevant interactions. A separate modelling may be required if the
                    probability of additional failure mechanisms induced by the space
                    environment cannot be neglected - e.g. space debris impact, see Section
