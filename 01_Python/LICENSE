The content of this digital handbook has been developed within the European Space 
Agency (ESA) project "New reliability prediction aimed at space applications" (NRPM) 
under ESA contract No. 4000121065/17/NL/PS (2017-2020).
As part of the ESA project "Adaptation of the NRPM Handbook into an ESA Handbook 
following the ECSS" (2021-2022) under ESA contract No. 4000135482/21/NL/AR/va, updated 
information on the PISTIS project has been added. Otherwise, no material changes 
have been made to the content.
 
As part of the ESA project "Adaptation of the NRPM Handbook into an ESA Handbook 
following the ECSS" the contents of the handbook were structured to meet the requirements 
for ESA handbooks.
 
In the context of the digitalization and possibilities of the digital world, within 
the ESA project "Adaptation of the NRPM Handbook into an ESA Handbook following the 
ECSS" the consortium under the ESA contract No. 4000135482/21/NL/AR/va developed 
the idea to create a digital interactive version besides the classical handbook version. 
In the project, the digital version was developed with the aim to show which interactive 
possibilities exist for books and to conduct a feasibility study for the implementation.
