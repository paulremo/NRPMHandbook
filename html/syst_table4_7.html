                <td>
                    A combination of component failures does not imply system failure in phase but is treated as system
                    failure in phase <i>i+1</i>.
                </td>
                <td>
                    This case should be treated as latent failures in the earlier phase <i>i</i> as well. This is because
                    such
                    combinations, once present during a phase are bound to lead to the system failure eventually at the
                    transition time when the system enters the later phase <i>i+1</i>.

                <td>
                    A combination of component failures implies system failure in phase <i>i</i> but does not imply system
                    failure in phase <i>i+1</i>.
                </td>
                <td>
                    We need to account for the probability of occurrence of these failure combinations only until phase
                    <i>i</i>. Any probability attributed to such combinations of component failures in later phases does not
                    contribute towards system unreliability.
