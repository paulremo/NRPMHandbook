            <tr>
                <td>
                    A combination of component failures does not imply system failure in phase but is treated as system
                    failure in phase $i+1$.
                </td>
                <td>
                    This case should be treated as latent failures in the earlier phase $i$ as well. This is because
                    such
                    combinations, once present during a phase are bound to lead to the system failure eventually at the
                    transition time when the system enters the later phase $i+1$.

                <td>
                    A combination of component failures implies system failure in phase $i$ but does not imply system
                    failure in phase $i+1$.
                </td>
                <td>
                    We need to account for the probability of occurrence of these failure combinations only until phase
                    $i$. Any probability attributed to such combinations of component failures in later phases does not
                    contribute towards system unreliability.
