                    failure rate is attributed to a class of miscellaneous item, derived
                    from IOR data and valid in a certain range of parameters. The model is
                    only valid for the design lifetime. It can be used beyond the design
                    lifetime in the case there is no wear.</td>

                        the space environment) it is necessary to address and to model
                        systematic failures. This is done based on statistics and not
                        considering the human factor as an initial root cause.</p>

                    on probability distribution (parameters derived from the duration for
                    qualification). The model addresses nominal lifetime and lifetime
