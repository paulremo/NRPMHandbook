# Process for mechanical reliability predicition

The approach for mechanical {term}`RELIABILITY PREDICTION` in space applications presented in this chapter is based on the following three steps, which are described in different Sections:

* {term}`FAILURE MECHANISM` identification and focus ([Section 4.4](failure_identification_focus.md))
The goal of this step is to decide what needs to be modelled, allowing to focus the analysis on items and {term}`FAILURE MECHANISM`s with non-negligible probability of failure.
* Selection of suitable methods and models ([Section 4.5](method_selection.md))
The method selection is centred around the dominating {term}`FAILURE MECHANISM`s identified in the first step with a focus on {term}`PHYSICS OF FAILURE` methods for {term}`RELIABILITY PREDICTION`. A more general overview considering all potential methods and inputs is found in [Section 4.3](data_sources_methods.md).
* Method implementation ([Sections 4.6](structural_method_input.md) and [4.7](structural_models_equations.md), [Section 4.8](examples.md) for examples)
Methods and Models to derive reliability estimates for different {term}`FAILURE MECHANISM`s are discussed with a focus on {term}`PHYSICS OF FAILURE` based methods. The implementation of other methods (e.g. {term}`STATISTICAL METHOD`s for a data-based approach) is discussed in [Section 4.3](data_sources_methods.md).

Before addressing these three steps, the following information is provided:

* [Section 4.2](root_causes_coverage.md) contains a discussion of the different {term}`FAILURE ROOT CAUSE`s (as classified in Chapter 4 Part I) and their coverage during Mechanical {term}`RELIABILITY PREDICTION`.
* [Section 4.3](data_sources_methods.md) contains a discussion of the different {term}`RELIABILITY PREDICTION` methods and inputs introduced in Chapter 6 (Part II).
