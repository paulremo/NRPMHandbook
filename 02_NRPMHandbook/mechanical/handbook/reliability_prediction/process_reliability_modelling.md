# Process for mechanical reliability predicition

The approach for mechanical {term}`reliability prediction <Reliability prediction>` in space applications presented in this handbook is based on the following three steps, which are described in different paragraphs:

* **Failure mechanism identification and focus** ({numref}`meca_9_4`)
The goal of this step is to decide what needs to be modelled, allowing to focus the analysis on items and {term}`failure mechanisms <Failure mechanism>` with non-negligible probability of failure.

* **Selection of suitable methods and models** ({numref}`meca_9_5`)

The method selection is centred around the dominating failure mechanisms identified in the first step with a focus on Physics of Failure (PoF) methods for reliability prediction. A more general overview considering all potential methods and inputs is found in {numref}`meca_9_3`.

* **Method implementation** ({numref}`meca_9_6` and {numref}`meca_9_7`, {numref}`meca_9_8` for examples)

Methods and models to derive reliability estimates for different failure mechanisms are discussed with a focus on PoF based methods. The implementation of other methods  (e.g. {term}`statistical methods <Statistical method>` for a data-based approach) is discussed in {numref}`meca_9_3`.

Before addressing these three steps, the following information is provided:

* {numref}`meca_9_2` contains a discussion of the different {term}`failure root causes <Failure root cause>` (as classified in {ref}`Part 1 - Methodologies <methodologies>`) and their coverage during mechanical {term}`reliability prediction <Reliability prediction>`.
* {numref}`meca_9_3` contains a discussion of the different reliability prediction methods and inputs introduced in {ref}`Part 2 - Methods <methods>`.
