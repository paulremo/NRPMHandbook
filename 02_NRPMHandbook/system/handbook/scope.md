# Scope

This digital platform mirrors the content of the ECSS-Q-HB-30-02A, Issue 1.

The focus of the present part is the selection and use of system level reliability methods. The reliability of all components ({term}`EEE`, {term}`MEC`, {term}`MIS`) are considered in the context of the system. 

In early project phases (Phases 0, A and B as defined in {cite:p}`sys-ECSS-M-ST-10C`), a system level reliability target for the space mission is defined. 

As systems are made of many interacting components, system target reliability should be allocated to individual component target reliabilities (top-down analysis).

In later project phases (Phases C and D as defined in {cite:p}`sys-ECSS-M-ST-10C`), after components are designed, system level reliability is estimated from part level reliability to assure that system reliability target is met (bottom-up analysis). 

Methodologies, for bottom-up system level reliability estimation are provided. If target system reliability is not met, the system can iteratively be optimized by repeating the top-down (reliability allocation) and bottom-up analyses. An overview of top-down and bottom-up system reliability analysis are provided, as well as guidelines for selecting modelling methodologies.
