# System level methods 

This section presents various system reliability modelling techniques such as reliability block diagrams (RBD), fault tree analysis (FTA), Markov models, Petri networks and Bayesian networks. The presented methods have in common that they aim at evaluating system reliability as a function of the constituting elements. All methods could be used for comparison of different design solutions and system architectures. The following table provides an overview of the different methods, indicating when which method should be used and also what limitation are associated with each of them.
