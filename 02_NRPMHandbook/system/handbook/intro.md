# System handbook

This chapter provides an overview of existing methods for system applications, followed by the consideration of *specific aspects relevant to space applications*, including reliability assessment of phased missions, the use of importance measures for system optimization, assessment of degraded system modes, modelling of common cause failures and system level considerations for wear-out failures. A dedicated section on non-part related {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` includes a satellite level anomaly occurrence model derived from *in orbit return* as well as a specific discussion on the consideration of software-related failures in the context of reliability prediction for space applications.
