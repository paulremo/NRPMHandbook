```

If you need more precise information, please go the this page.

The plot below shows the weight of questions

```{glue:} plot_weight_hist
```

The plot below shows the repartition of grades according to the weights with an indication about the level if the information

```{glue:} fig_scatter_grade
```

And finally, the plot below shows the repartition of levels.

```{glue:} fig_level_pie
```

Best practice ?

```{glue:} hist_weights
```

```{glue:} pie_levels
```

Plotly

```{glue:} plotly_scattered
```
