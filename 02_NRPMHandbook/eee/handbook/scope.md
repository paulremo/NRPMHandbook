# Scope

The reliability.space handbook was developed during an ESA study aiming at the development of a reliability prediction methodology for space applications.

The objective of the handbook is to provide a methodology dedicated to space designs, identifying and bypassing the limitations and shortcomings of existing reliability prediction methodologies, which were largely focussing on ground applications.

The term Reliability Prediction (RP) is here understood as the process, or outcome, of estimating (predicting) the reliability of a system or its components, i.e. the probability of success. In the more general context of RAMS analyses, making use of qualitative and quantitative techniques, Reliability Prediction is restricted to providing quantitative estimates for the probability of success or failure. The focus of the methodology presented herein is on Reliability in this narrow sense. Specific requirements of Availability, Maintainability or Safety analyses have not been considered during the development of the methodology and are out of the handbook's scope, even though the probabilistic methods provided may of course also be used to support these analyses.

For the purpose of the Handbook, the term Space Applications refers to Reliability Predictions for systems that operate in space, e.g. a spacecraft. While parts of the methodology may also be used to model end-to-end systems including the ground segment, the handbook does not cover aspects specific to ground applications, e.g. related to the effect of ground environmental conditions. In terms of technology coverage, the methodology is limited to unmanned spacecraft technology.

Even though the handbook targets decision support, the decision-making as such is left to the user; reliability prediction is limited to providing the numbers that can be used to decide in a given trade-off situation. Also the practical implementation and development or choice of suitable Software tools is out of scope for the handbook. As a general rule, models are provided with full detail, allowing the development of tools without any restrictions regarding the information needed to implement the models.

The present handbook is made available to users in two forms:

-   A classical handbook

-   A digital interactive handbook.

This chapter corresponds to **Chapter 3**: EEE Handbook of The Adaptation of the NRPM Handbook into an ESA Handbook following the ECSS.
