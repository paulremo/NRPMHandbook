This table contains, for each phase of the development and manufacturing, the recommendations for the satisfaction level of the questions of the questionnaire to estimate the process factor $\PI_{\text{Process}}$ for quality and technical control over reliability in the product life cycle as defined in Section {numref}`eee_4_1`. It considers also the modified questions of {ref}`eee_annex_c` adapted to space applications. The recommendations are done for the following contributors:

-   The prime contractor for classical space applications;

-   The sub-contractor for classical space applications;

-   The prime contractor for newspace applications;

-   The sub-contractor for newspace applications.

The responses and demonstrations made during the questionnaire will be used to fix a Satisfaction\_mark to the recommendation (levels L1 to L4):

-   L1 = the recommendation is not applied, definite risks regarding reliability;

-   L2 = the recommendation is only partially applied, potential risks regarding reliability;

-   L3 = the recommendation is practically applied, few risks regarding reliability;

-   L4 = the recommendation is fully applied, no significant risk regarding reliability.

Generally, each question is dedicated to either the prime contractor or the sub-contractor. When one of them has an assigned level from L1 to L4, the other is considered as Non Applicable. Some questions are also Not Applicable for both as they are not relevant for the space industry. The list of these Not Applicable questions are the following:

-   Phase "Specification": question n째117;

-   Phase "Design": questions n째87 and 147;

-   Phase "Operation and Maintenance": questions n째20, 35, 47, 63, 66, 67, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82 and 91;

-   Phase "Support Activities": question n째110;

    - Maintenance procedures related to corrective actions in production must include:<ul><li>Effective processing of complaints and subassembly nonconformity reports,</li><li>The search for causes of nonconformity related to the process and recording of the results of this search,</li><li>Determination of corrective actions necessary to eliminate causes of nonconformity,</li><li>Application of control means to assure that the corrective action is implemented and that it produces the required effect.</li>
    - Does corrective maintenance take place as soon as an anomaly appears on production means or produced subassemblies?

    - Based on the defined preventive maintenance plan and after its production, a correction is made by: redefining production means references, replacement of consumables, replacement of worn and therefore potentially defective parts (probes and inspection tools).
    - Is preventive maintenance planned to correct drifts to production means parameters?

    - This verification is less complicated than a planned preventive maintenance action, and should be done by the user of the means (it forms part of the operator's training). Its purpose is to make sure that the operation will be done correctly and that it will provide the expected result (using the right loaded software or a correct configuration). The frequency of the verifications (to be defined) may be systematic before each use or after a defined number of uses of the means.
    - Is there a periodic verification of programming means so that the software loading operation is done correctly?

    - This filter assures that the final test that forms the final verification milestone is carried out by a competent person and particularly a person whose skills are monitored to assure that the most recent requirements are taken into consideration. The audit assures that the operator reviews control over procedures and critical points, to achieve perfect confidence in execution of the final test.
    - Are the skills of final test operators systematically audited?

    - It is important to perform the minimum number of manipulations of subassemblies during the production phase to limit risks of mechanical shocks and other overstresses. Furthermore, the automation of manipulations between activities during the entire production provides a means of eliminating a large number of failures caused by human intervention. This recommendation remains applicable to very small series

    - It is essential to specifically monitor and maintain (by updating) references coordinates, batch numbers, etc.) loaded in production tools, for the automation of tasks and for reliable execution of activities.
