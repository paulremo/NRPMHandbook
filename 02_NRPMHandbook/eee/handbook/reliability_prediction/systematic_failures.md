# Systematic failures

In the classification of {term}`failure root causes <Failure root cause>`, the {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` are considered as major contributors to the total anomalies occurring on board of a satellite. For EEE components and electronic equipment, the {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` are linked mainly to the design and manufacturing errors such as errors during the design of the electronic boards, or during the soldering of EEE components on the electronic boards.

The FIDES methodology does not consider random and {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` separately; all failures are considered as "random" and no specific prediction model for {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` is included. {term}`Systematic failures <Systematic failure>` are partly addressed and covered in the process questionnaire. However, this questionnaire has not been designed to allow for a clear split between random and {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>`. So, the only way to specifically address {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>` is to perform a prediction at system level according to the methodology described in Chapter 2.
