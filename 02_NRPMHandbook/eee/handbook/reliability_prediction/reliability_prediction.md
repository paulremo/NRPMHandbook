# Reliability prediction for EEE components and assemblies

This chapter of the handbook deals with the EEE components and assemblies identified in the EEPL list of components presented in {ref}`eee_annex_a`,

{numref}`eee_4_1` will allow introducing the main concepts and strategy for data sources and methods selections for EEE components and assemblies modelling. And {numref}`eee_4_2` will introduce the notion of failure coverage (Random Failures, Systematic Failures, Extrinsic Failures and Wear-out failures) for EEE components in the context of Space applications.

Then in the following sections ({numref}`eee_4_3` to {numref}`eee_4_6`), these four aspects are considered for all families and subfamilies.

The general elements and each component family section have a specific Annex listing all the formulae, figures, tables and additional data to be known for applying the process.

The methods and models proposed in this handbook can all apply to the standard type of modelling for space applications as well as for the new space and next space approaches -- when differences should be considered, it is indicated in the respective annex ({ref}`eee_annex_a` for general, {ref}`eee_annex_b` for Capacitors, {ref}`eee_annex_c` for Connectors and so on).

As a reminder, New Space (or Next Space) can be defined as follows: a notion first introduced around 2010-2015, corresponding to an ongoing transformation of the space sector, which is driving new ways to develop space product. It concerns several notions, among which the overall cost that should be lower than for the "old" space and the resort to the newest technologies in the limits of their applicability for Space. In practice it is translated through the level of quality of the different elements within the spacecraft -- commercial procurement vs space and MIL levels, through the tiers involved at Service, System and Suppliers' level -- newcomers for the space activities as well as historical companies, and through the new concepts developed.
