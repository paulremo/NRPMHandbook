# Reliability prediction for EEE components and assemblies

This part of the handbook deals with the {term}`EEE` components and assemblies identified in the EEPL list of components presented in {ref}`eee_annex_a` of this part,

{numref}`eee_8_1` allows introducing the main concepts and strategy for data sources and methods selections for EEE components and assemblies modelling, as {numref}`eee_8_2` will introduces the notion of failure coverage ({term}`random failures <Random failure>`, {term}`systematic failures <Systematic failure>`, {term}`extrinsic Failures <Extrinsic failure>` and {term}`degradation failures <Degradation failure>`) for EEE components in the context of space applications.

Then, in the following paragraphs ({numref}`eee_8_3` to {numref}`eee_8_6`), these four aspects are considered for all families and subfamilies.

The general elements and each component family section have a specific dedicated Annex listing all the formulae, figures, tables and additional data to be known for applying the process. 

The methods and models proposed in this handbook can all apply to the standard type of modelling for space applications as well as for the {term}`new space <New space>` approach.
