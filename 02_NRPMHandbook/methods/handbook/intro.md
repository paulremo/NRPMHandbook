# Methods handbook

This chapter provides information on different *reliability prediction* and *methods inputs*, allowing to understand the background of the models defined in the **EEE chapter** ({numref}`sec_eee_handbook`, {numref}`sec_eee_models`), **mechanical chapter** ({numref}`sec_mech_handbook`, {numref}`sec_mech_models`), **miscellaneous chapter** ({numref}`sec_misc_handbook`, {numref}`sec_misc_models`), and **system chapter** ({numref}`sec_sys_handbook`, {numref}`sec_sys_models`). The different reliability prediction inputs considered are: in orbit return, manufacturer data, {term}`test data <Test data>`, handbook data, and {term}`failure mechanism <Failure mechanism>` analysis. With these inputs, reliability prediction models can be derived using {term}`statistical methods <Statistical method>`, {term}`physics of failure <Physics of failure>` approaches or a combination of both, see {numref}`Figure_method_0`. Specific attention is given to the combined approach using *Bayesian methods*, allowing to make best use of all available information. Finally, this chapter is completed with a discussion of *uncertainties associated with a prediction*, including both model development uncertainties as well as uncertainties resulting from assumptions made by model users.
