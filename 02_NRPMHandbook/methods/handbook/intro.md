# Part 2 - Methods

This part of the handbook, Part 2, is dedicated to presenting the different methods available to perform reliability predictions ({term}`RP`). 

It starts with reminding the main concept, such as the statistical approach, the physics of failures (PoF) approach and the combined approach, in {numref}`method_5`, before fully developing the combined approach most used for space applications, the Bayesian approach in {numref}`method_6`. 
Finally, {numref}`method_7` addresses the uncertainties of the models and how to deal with them. 

The different reliability prediction inputs considered are: in-orbit return (IOR), manufacturer data, test data, handbook data, and failure mechanism analysis. 
With these inputs, reliability prediction models can be derived using statistical methods, PoF approaches or a combination of both, see {numref}`Figure_method_0`.
