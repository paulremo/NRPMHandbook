# Scope

In order to harmonize the methodologies for different applications, {term}`NRPM` starts with the formulation of an overall framework formed by the **methodologies** ({numref}`methodologies`) and **methods chapters**. The framework merges all aspects of reliability prediction, even though these may be handled by different methods and thus provides a basis and background for the models (**EEE chapter** ({numref}`sec_eee_handbook`, {numref}`sec_eee_models`), **mechanical chapter** ({numref}`sec_mech_handbook`, {numref}`sec_mech_models`), **miscellaneous chapter** ({numref}`sec_misc_handbook`, {numref}`sec_misc_models`), **system chapter** ({numref}`sec_sys_handbook`, {numref}`sec_sys_models`)) 

The framework is used to establish a link between different aspects of reliability (and associated methods) and the objectives of {term}`RP`, i.e., the decisions that will be supported by the prediction results. It is the basis to select the required methods for a given application. In addition, the framework will also be used to provide guidance on the development of {term}`RP` methods for future technologies. Thus, the framework is essential as background information and constitutes the basis of reliability.space.
