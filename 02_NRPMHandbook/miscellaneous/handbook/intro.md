# Part 5 - Miscellaneous

{term}`Miscellaneous items <Miscellaneous item>` include parts that are difficult to classify into one of the two previous categories, i.e. {term}`EEE` ({ref}`Part 3 - EEE <sec_EEE_handbook>`) or mechanical ({ref}`Part 4 - MEC <sec_mech_handbook>`). 

In addition, items that are either EEE or mechanical but difficult to model with the domain specific methods, fall into this category. 

A standard model is provided for reliability prediction of generic miscellaneous items found on many space systems, starting from base failure rates or probabilities of failure that have been derived from in-orbit return ({term}`IOR`) collected at prime contractor level. 

Specific miscellaneous items can be modelled with the same approach, yet they require the use of other data sources for the derivation of an appropriate base failure rate or probability of failure.
