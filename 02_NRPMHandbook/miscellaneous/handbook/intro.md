# Miscellaneous handbook

{term}`Miscellaneous items <Miscellaneous item>` include parts that are difficult to classify into one of the two previous categories, i.e. {term}`EEE` ({numref}`sec_eee_handbook`, {numref}`sec_eee_models`) or mechanical ({numref}`sec_mech_handbook`. In addition, items that are either {term}`EEE` or mechanical but difficult to model with the domain specific methods fall into this category. A standard model is provided for reliability prediction of generic {term}`miscellaneous items <Miscellaneous item>` found on many satellites, starting from base failure rates or probabilities of failure that have been derived from *in orbit return* collected at prime contractor level. Specific {term}`miscellaneous items <Miscellaneous item>` can be modelled with the same approach, yet requiring the use of other data sources for the derivation of an appropriate base failure rate or probability of failure.
