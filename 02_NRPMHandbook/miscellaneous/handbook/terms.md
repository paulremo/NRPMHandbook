## Terms specific for the present handbook

```{glossary}
Bayesian inference
    a process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying distribution of probability in which the Bayes theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available

Contributing factor
	 an event or condition that may have been one of the causes to the occurrence of an undesired outcome 

Deep Sub Micron
	 corresponds to Integrated Circuits technologies allowing a very high integration of parts but inducing potential new phenomena, e.g. increased sensitivity to radiations and potential decreasing of operating lifetime of the parts 

Degradation
	 a progressive failure is characterized by the degradation in time - or equivalent time, such as cycles - of an item’s performances (modification of the design characteristics due to a degradation/wear-out process) up to a definitive failure. 

Design FMEA
	 FMEA in which the design of product is analysed. All potential failure modes due to design errors are identified, analysed in terms of severity, occurrence and detectability on ground, and actions plans are put into place in order to reduce one of these three characteristics to remain within acceptable limits.  

EEE part
	  a component which performs electrical, electronic or electromechanical (EEE) function and is built with one or more elements assembled together in a manner that they cannot be separated without destroying the component. 

Epistemic uncertainty
	 results from our poor understanding of the relevant aspects which include statistical uncertainties and models uncertainties

Extrinsic failure
	 sudden failure induced by the space environment on the spacecraft elements

Failure mechanism
	 the physical process by which an element fails (e.g. electromigration for EEE parts or fracture/fatigue for mechanical parts)

Failure mode and effects summary FMES
	 abstract of lower level failure modes with the same effects from the respective lower level FMEA

Failure root cause
	 one of multiple factors (events, conditions or organizational factors) that contributed to or created the proximate cause and subsequent undesired outcome and, if eliminated, or modified would have prevented the undesired outcome  

Handbook data source
	 it corresponds to a document compiling either models or data to be used for reliability calculations

In-orbit return (IOR) data
	 it corresponds to reliability information (Failure Rates or mission probability success) obtained through the analysis of in-orbit feedback at different levels

Level of confidence
	 it corresponds to the probability for an interval to contain the parameter to be estimated (estimation by interval)

Manufacturer part
	 it corresponds to information obtained for a part, a unit or a subsystem through its manufacturing process, its physical production 

Miscellaneous item
	 either parts or assemblies that can neither be classified as EEE or mechanical parts/units (e.g. due to their EEE-mechanical hybrid aspect or to their complexity)

Mission lifetime
	 the time during which the system shall perform the specified mission (functions and performances). 

Model uncertainty
	 it results from modelling assumptions and simplifications made

New space
	 a notion first introduced around 2010-2015, corresponding to an ongoing transformation of the space systems, which is driving new ways to develop space product concerning several notions, among which the overall cost and the resort to the newest technologies in the limits of their applicability for Space 

Pertinence
	  it corresponds to the consistency between what has been predicted and what can be observed

Physics of failure
	a technique under the practice of design for reliability that leverages the knowledge and understanding of the processes and mechanisms that induce failure to predict reliability and improve product performance. (source: Wikipedia) 

Probability density function
	 for a discrete distribution, it corresponds to the potential cases for which the variate has the value x

Random failure
	 a failure occurring at a unexpected time due to a residual internal part defect or weakness when submitted to normal operational stresses

Reliability prediction
	 the process of estimating the reliability of a system or its components under specified conditions or the result of the analysis 

Reliability prediction methodology
	 it refers to the reliability prediction process and the selection of suitable methods and models

Reliability prediction method
	 a process or modelling approach to perform a reliability prediction related to a certain failure event (or several events) based on the information available on it

Reliability prediction model
	 a mathematical representation of the real world that is based on suitable methods, data and information, and ready to perform a reliability prediction related to a certain failure event (or several events).

Reliability prediction space application
	 application (of a reliability prediction methodology, method or model) for a system that is intended to operate in space.

HF/RF passive part
	 electronic component used for radio frequency signal transmission/reception for which there is no external power supply required.

Safe life qualification
	 qualification process for a product regarding its capability to sustain its specified design lifetime (degradation(s) compliant with the specification)

Simplified structural reliability method
	 it corresponds to a simplified form of structural reliability methods, which needs less knowledge of probabilistic methods to be established and can be solved analytically.

Statistical method
	 a technique for which RP models are based on what has been observed on an item in terms of functioning/non-functioning, generally through tests or field return, without further analysis of the potential root cause or failure mechanism

Statistical uncertainty
	 it results from limited data samples used to derive a model (e.g. cumulated hours, observed failures) used to derive a model

Structural reliability method
	 a class of Physics of Failure techniques which are based on a mathematical model of the failure mechanism(s) for a specific part or item (not limited to structures) and probabilistic modelling of the uncertainties associated with the relevant physical variables (e.g. . the stress-strength interference method for structural parts is a simple example for the usage of structural reliability methods)

Sudden failure
	 a failure is sudden when the transition from the normal state (nominal performances of the elements) to the failed state is instantaneous or is very short.

Systematic failure
	 a failure, related in a deterministic way to a certain cause, which can only be eliminated by a modification of the design, the manufacturing process or the operational procedures. 

System engineering
	 an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems which focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, and then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, manufacturing, and disposal. (International Council on Systems Engineering INCOSE)

Test data
	 it corresponds to reliability data obtained through tests 

Wear-out failure
	 a definitive failure resulting from progressive degradation of an item’s performances in time due to calendar aging or due to operational and/or environmental stresses
