# Methodologies

This chapter explains the framework and taxonomy used in the {term}`NRPM` handbook and links it to the reliability prediction process and usage. It provides guidance for users that are in charge of planning a prediction. The *taxonomy* is defined on two major axes: (1) the *type of elements* (EEE, Mechanical, and Miscellaneous elements) and (2) the *failure root causes* (random, systematic, wear-out, and extrinsic failures), see {numref}`Figure_methodo_0` for an overview. Moreover, this part describes the general *reliability prediction framework* and how it should be used. A number of *ground rules and assumptions* are described which should be agreed upon before starting a prediction. This includes the *scope and focus* in terms of failure root causes to be covered in a prediction for a specific use. Finally, the use of predictions during the *project life cycle* is adressed.
