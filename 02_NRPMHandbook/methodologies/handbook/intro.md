# Methodologies handbook

This chapter explains the framework and taxonomy used in the reliability.space handbook and links it to the reliability prediction process and usage. It provides guidance for users that are in charge of planning a prediction. The *taxonomy* is defined on two major axes: (1) the *type of elements* ({term}`EEE`, Mechanical, and Miscellaneous elements) and (2) the *{term}`failure root causes <Failure root cause>`* (random, systematic, wear-out, and {term}`extrinsic failures <Extrinsic failure>`), see {numref}`Figure_methodo_0` for an overview. Moreover, this part describes the general *reliability prediction framework* and how it should be used. A number of *ground rules and assumptions* are described which should be agreed upon before starting a prediction. This includes the *scope and focus* in terms of {term}`failure root causes <Failure root cause>` to be covered in a prediction for a specific use. Finally, the use of predictions during the *project life cycle* is adressed.
