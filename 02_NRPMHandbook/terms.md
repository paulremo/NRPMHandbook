BAYESIAN INFERENCE
    The Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which the Bayes theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. 

COMMON CAUSE FAILURE

DEGRADATION (PROGRESSIVE) FAILURE
	 A progressive failure is characterized by the degradation in time - or equivalent time, such as cycles - of an item’s performances (modification of the design characteristics due to a degradation/wear-out process) up to a definitive failure. 

DFMEA
	 Design FMEA : FMEA in which the design of product is analysed. All potential failure modes due to design errors are identified, analysed in terms of severity, occurrence and detectability on ground, and actions plans are put into place in order to reduce one of these three characteristics to remain within acceptable limits.  

EEE PART
	  A component which performs electrical, electronic or electromechanical (EEE) function and is built with one or more elements assembled together in a manner that they cannot be separated without destroying the component.

	 Integrated set of parts and components. 

EXTRINSIC FAILURE
	 An extrinsic failure is a sudden failure induced by the space environment on the spacecraft elements.

FAILURE

MECHANICAL PART
	 A non-electronics part, i.e. a piece of hardware which is not electrical, electronic or electromechanical, and which performs a simple elementary function or part of a function in such a way that it can be evaluated as a whole against expected requirements of performance and cannot be disassembled without destroying this capability.

MECHANISM
	 Assembly of parts that are linked together to enable a relative motion. 

MISCELLANEOUS ITEM
	 In this study, miscellaneous items are either parts or assemblies that can neither be classified as EEE or mechanical parts/units (e.g. due to their EEE-mechanical hybrid aspect or to their complexity). 

MISSION LIFETIME
	 The mission lifetime is the time during which the system shall perform the specified mission (functions and performances). 

MODEL UNCERTAINTY
	 Model uncertainties result from modelling assumptions and simplifications made.

NEW SPACE
	 A notion first introduced around 2010-2015, corresponding to an ongoing transformation of the space sector, which is driving new ways to develop space product. It concerns several notions, among which the overall cost that should be lower than for the “old” space and the resort to the newest technologies in the limits of their applicability for Space. In practice it is translated through the level of quality of the different elements within the spacecraft – commercial procurement vs space and MIL levels, through the tiers involved at Service, System and Suppliers’ level – newcomers for the space activities as well as historical companies, and through the new concepts developed.

PART/COMPONENT
	 A part is a set of materials, assembled according to defined and controlled processes, which cannot be disassembled without destroying its capability and which performs a simple function that can be evaluated against expected performance requirements. (“part” is preferred when referring to purely mechanical devices, “component” is preferred for EEE devices).

PERTINENCE
	  Pertinence corresponds to the consistency between what has been predicted and what can be observed

PFMEA
	 Process FMEA : FMEA considering the analysis of processes such as manufacturing, assembling and integration or pre‐launch operations. All potential failure modes due to process variability and manufacturing errors are identified, analysed in terms of severity, occurrence and detectability on ground, and actions plans are put into place in order to reduce one of these three characteristics to remain within acceptable limits.

PHYSICS OF FAILURE
	The physics of failure concept is a technique under the practice of design for reliability that leverages the knowledge and understanding of the processes and mechanisms that induce failure to predict reliability and improve product performance. 

PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION
	 For a discrete distribution, the probability density function (PDF) is the probability that the variate has the value x. Since for continuous distributions the probability at a single point is zero, the PDF is expressed as the probability for a random variable X to be in the interval [x, x+dx( for dx0.

QUALITY 
	 Degree to which a set of characteristics of a product or a process fulfils requirements. 

RANDOM FAILURE
	 A Random failure is a failure occurring at a random time due to a residual internal part defect or weakness when submitted to normal operational stresses.

RELIABILITY PREDICTION
	 The process of estimating (predicting) the reliability of a system or its components under specified conditions. Also the outcome of this process, the reliability estimate, can be called a Reliability Prediction. 

RELIABILITY PREDICTION METHODOLOGY
	 The RP methodology refers to the reliability prediction process and the selection of suitable methods and models.

RELIABILITY PREDICTION METHOD
	 A method or modelling approach to perform a reliability prediction related to a certain failure event (or several events) based on the information available on it.

RELIABILITY PREDICTION MODEL
	 A mathematical representation of the real world that is based on suitable methods, data and information, and ready to perform a reliability prediction related to a certain failure event (or several events).

RELIABILITY PREDICTION SPACE APPLICATION
	 Application (of a reliability prediction methodology, method or model) for a system that is intended to operate in space.

REQUIREMENT

RF PASSIVE PART
	 Part used for radio frequency signal transmission/reception for which there is no external power supply required.

SAFE LIFE QUALIFICATION
	 Qualification of a product regarding its capability to sustain its specified design lifetime (degradation(s) compliant with the specification).

	 it corresponds to a simplified form of structural reliability methods, which needs less knowledge of probabilistic methods to be established and can be solved analytically. 

SPACECRAFT
	 manned or unmanned vehicle designed to orbit or travel in space. Note A spacecraft is a space segment element.

SPACE SEGMENT
	 Part of a space system, placed in Space, to fulfil the space mission objectives. 

STATISTICAL METHOD
	 A statistical method is a method for which RP models are based on what has been observed on an item in terms of functioning/non-functioning, generally through tests or field return, without further analysis of the potential root cause or failure mechanism.

STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY
	 The statistical uncertainties result from limited data samples used to derive a model (e.g. cumulated hours, observed failures) used to derive a model.

STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY METHOD
	 Structural reliability methods are here defined as a class of Physics of Failure methods which are based on a mathematical model of the  failure mechanism(s) for a specific part or item (not limited to structures) and probabilistic modelling of the uncertainties associated with the relevant physical variables. The well-known stress-strength interference method for structural parts is a simple example for the usage of structural reliability methods.

SUDDEN FAILURE
	 A failure is sudden when the transition from the normal state (nominal performances of the elements) to the failed state is instantaneous or is very short.

SYSTEM
	 A system is a set of interrelated or interacting functions constituted to achieve a specified objective.

SYSTEMATIC FAILURE
	 A Systematic failure is a failure, related in a deterministic way to a certain cause, which can only be eliminated by a modification of the design, the manufacturing process or the operational procedures. 

SYSTEM ENGINEERING
	 Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, and then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem: operations, cost and schedule, performance, training and support, test, manufacturing, and disposal.

TEST
	 Measurement of product characteristics, performance or functions under representative environments. 

TEST DATA
	 Test data corresponds to reliability data obtained through tests. 

WEAR-OUT FAILURE
	 A wear-out failure is a definitive failure resulting from progressive degradation of an item’s performances in time due to calendar aging or due to operational and/or environmental stresses.
